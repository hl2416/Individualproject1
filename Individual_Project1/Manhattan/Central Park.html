          Central Park is a park located in the middle of upper Manhattan. It is the most visited park in the United States and the fifth largest park in New York City. There is no fee for
          entering the park but certain attractions within it may cost money. It has wide open areas perfect for picnics and scenic lakes. It also has an ice skating ring open at certain
          times of the year as well as the Central Park Zoo. It is a great place for enjoying the attractions available inside or to just take a walk, enjoying the nature with some exercise.

          I have actually been in Central Park a few times before, with and without friends. It is a popular area to relax in and is the destination for some of my school field trips.
          However, I cannot say I know much about it as I do not usually go to the attractions nor look it up out of interest. To me, it is just a place to relax on walks, or to meet up with
          friends as it is a famous place. My walks usually end up with me moving in a circle near the same area where I would get a similar view of everything around: trees, grass, flowers,
          horse carriages, people walking around or exercising. After moving away from Manhattan, I have not been there since as it was simply too far away. If you plan on going, I am sure
          you would be able to enjoy it more than I do, especially if you go with a plan.
