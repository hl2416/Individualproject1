          Manhattan is possibly the most important borough of New York City. It makes up a part of the upper area of New York City just below the Bronx. It is also the location for multiple
          important buildings and tourist attractions such as the One World Trade Center, the United Nations Headquarters, the Empire State Building, Central Park, etc. It is surrounded by 4
          bodies of water with them being the Hudson River, East River, Upper Bay, and the Harlem River which separates it from the Bronx to the North.

          Manhattan was where I lived my early childhood, walking around Midtown and Chinatown as well as going to school before we moved in the middle of junior high. This familiarized
          me with the subway system of New York City as I would need to take an hour train ride to school with all the transfers after. Midtown was an area abundant with a multitude of stores
          ranging from fast food, to clothing, to souvenirs for tourists, and more. It was an area with a lot of bright flashing lights and tall buildings. Some areas were more modern with
          glass buildings while some areas were made of old red/white bricks and tiles. Sometimes, I was not able to tell if a building was residential or served some other purpose. Chinatown
          on the other hand, was mostly of old bricks and tiles. There were not as much tall buildings and the roads were narrower, constantly in repair. Both of these are areas I was most
          familiar with as a child. However, I have not really visited those areas since I moved so I am not sure what it would be like now.
