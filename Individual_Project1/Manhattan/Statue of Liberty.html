          The Statue of Liberty is a massive copper statue given to the United States as a gift in 1886 by France. It is seen as a symbol of freedom with broken chains scattered around her
          feet. Originally the same color as its material, it is now green because of oxidation. One can climb the inside of the statue up to the top of the torch or just below the crown.
          The Statue of Liberty isn't really in Manhattan and is on an island a little away called Ellis Island which was originally an immigration office. Nowadays, it is a tourist site
          and you would need to get a ticket for a ship to the island in Manhattan or New Jersey.

          Truthfully, I have never actually gone inside the Statue of Liberty although I have taken a cruise around Ellis Island to see the Statue. Most of the information above are pieces I
          picked up from living in NYC, either from surfing the web when I was bored or reading about it from a book my teacher assigned in my childhood. But what I do know and what everyone
          also knows is that the view would be great up there, same with every tall structure you look down from. Its just I never really kept enough interest to actually go and buy a ticket
          up there. There are also times where certain areas in the Statue are closed off for renovation or maintenance so you would need to do your research to see when the best time to go
          there would be.
