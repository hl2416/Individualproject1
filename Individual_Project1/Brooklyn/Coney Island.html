          Coney Island is an area at the very bottom of Brooklyn next to the lower bay. It is both a residential and entertainment area as seen in the picture to the right which shows the
          amusement park, beach, and the residential buildings with balconies. The amusement park is separated from the beach by a wooden walkway which has buildings for food and souvenirs
          as well as a building with a restroom and for changing which can be seen to the left of the picture as the short brown building. Around the beach, there are metal or plastic
          mechanisms that may shoot out water. The amusement park has a multitude of different rides for both adults and kids such as roller coasters and carousels.

          Funnily enough, when we lived in Manhattan, we would often go to Coney Island in Brooklyn in the summer. Now, when we live much closer, we rarely go anymore to the point where it is
          just a memory. Back when we frequently visited Coney Island, it was always a busy place with high energy. The beach, the walkway, and the amusement park would always be packed with
          people eating, lounging, playing, or just walking around in swimsuits or whatever casual wear they had that day. It was standard beach and amusement park so if you enjoy amusement
          park rides such as roller coasters or ferris wheels, or enjoy relaxing/playing on the beach while also eating amusement park food. This is the place for you. Although it is a little
          too crowded for my taste.
