          The Bronx is the borough I know the least about out of the 3 that I mentioned in the homepage as I have really only walked around it for a bit. It is located to the far North of
          New York City, just above Manhattan, and is separated from Manhattan by the Harlem River which is much smaller than the other rivers mentioned on this website. It has roads
          connecting it to Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Queens. It borders Westchester County to the North of it.

          As stated above, I know the least about the Bronx compared to the other two boroughs on this website. What I do know is that compared to Manhattan, it does not have as much tall
          buildings and has quite a bit of open space which can be seen from the 3 big parks within it. In the map to the right, there are 3 attractions shown but this site will only talk a
          bit about one of them which is the Bronx Zoo. This is because I have only been near those attractions once. For the New York Botanical Garden, I was close to it when I was near the
          Bronx Zoo but did not go in. If you like what you hear from the Brooklyn Botanical Garden page, you should also check out the New York Botanical Garden. As for the Yankee Stadium,
          I have been inside it once on a field trip and all I remember about it was that I bought and ate a hot dog there. But it being a pretty famous stadium warrants a look if you are
          interested in baseball.
